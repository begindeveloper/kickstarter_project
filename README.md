# kickstarter_project
In this project, I will explore and analyze Kickstarter project data using SQL. 
Iâ€™ll begin by importing and examining the dataset, laying the groundwork for my analysis. After that, I will focus on cleaning the data to ensure its accuracy and reliability.

Next, I'll write SQL queries to uncover valuable trends and insights within the data, such as success rates by category and funding goals. This process will allow me to dig deeper into the factors influencing project outcomes.

By the end of this project, I will have sharpened my SQL skills and will be able to derive meaningful insights from real-world datasets, empowering me to make data-driven decisions in future analyses. I'm excited to embark on this journey of discovery and learning!
